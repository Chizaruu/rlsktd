# RLSKTD
Roguelike Starter Kit (Top Down)

## What is RLSKTD?
RLSKTD is a roguelike framework designed to be a starting point for roguelike games in the top-down view.

## How did you come up with the idea?
I came up with the idea for RLSKTD after I saw the need for a roguelike framework that would be easy to use and easy to expand.

I  found the idea for this framework in a talk given by Josh Ge during the 2018 Roguelike Celebration, where he described the necessary steps to create a working roguelike game.

## What is the current status of RLSKTD?
Not all of the features have been implemented yet to an acceptable state.

For example, the framework is currently missing the following:

- Items
    - Item sprites
- Monsters
    - Monster generation
    - Monster sprites
- GUI
    - Prototype images
- Maps
    - Map generation
    - Dungeon generation

## How to get started
This repository heavily uses Sirenix OdinInspector for Serialization.

Place OdinInspector within the Project/External directory to use this repository properly.

OdinInspector - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041 (Highly Recommended)

## Notes
Please note that this is a work in progress and is not yet complete.
The goal is to have a playable working framework in the Unity Editor.
There are a few things I haven't yet implemented, but I am working on them.
I will be adding more content as I go along.
And will, at some point, offer a full tutorial.

I have created all assets/scripts in this repository to be a starting point for new roguelikes.
I, at any point, may modify all of the content to provide a better experience and meet the community's needs.
