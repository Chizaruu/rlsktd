 Roguelike Starter Kit (Top Down)

This repository uses Sirenix OdinInspector for Serialization.

To use this repository properly, place either OdinInspector or OdinSerializer within the Project/External directory.

OdinInspector - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041 (Highly Recommended)

OdinSerializer - https://odininspector.com/download#serializer (Desired namespace is Sirenix)

The foundation for this repo will follow the roguelike guidelines set forward by Josh Ge during the 2018 Roguelike Celebration.

## Notes
Please note that this is a work in progress and is not yet complete.
The goal is to have a working framework that is playable in the Unity Editor.
There are a few things that are not yet implemented, but I am working on them.
I will be adding more content as I go along.
And will, at some point, offer a full tutorial.

All of the content in this repo is intended to be used as a starting point for your own roguelike.
All of the content may be modified at any time to provide a better experience and to meet the community's needs.
