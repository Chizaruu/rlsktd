# RLSKTD
Roguelike Starter Kit (Top Down)

## What is RLSKTD?
RLSKTD is a roguelike framework that is designed to be a starting point for roguelike games in the top down view.

## How did you come up with the idea?
I came up with the idea for RLSKTD after I saw the need for a roguelike framework that would be easy to use and easy to expand upon.

This idea was insprired by talk given by Josh Ge during the 2018 Roguelike Celebration where he described the neccesary steps to create a working roguelike game.

## What is the current status of RLSKTD?
Not all of the features have been implemented yet to an acceptable state.

For example, the game is currently missing the following:

- Items
    - Item generation
    - Item sprites
- Monsters
    - Monster generation
    - Monster sprites
- GUI
    - Prototype images
- Maps
    - Map generation
    - Dungeon generation
- Modularization (i.e. ability to add new features)
    - Ability to add new features
    - Ability to add new features to existing features

## How to get started
This repository heavily uses Sirenix OdinInspector for Serialization.

To use this repository properly, place either OdinInspector or OdinSerializer within the Project/External directory.

OdinInspector - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041 (Highly Recommended)

OdinSerializer - https://odininspector.com/download#serializer (Desired namespace is Sirenix)

## Notes
Please note that this is a work in progress and is not yet complete.
The goal is to have a working framework that is playable in the Unity Editor.
There are a few things that are not yet implemented, but I am working on them.
I will be adding more content as I go along.
And will, at some point, offer a full tutorial.

All of the content in this repo is intended to be used as a starting point for your own roguelike.
All of the content may be modified at any time to provide a better experience and to meet the community's needs.
